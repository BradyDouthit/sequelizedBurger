# Sequelized Burger App
## Deployed Heroku link: https://floating-depths-75632.herokuapp.com/  

## Tools Used
MySQL, Sequelize, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## What can it do?
Well, it is a simple app I developed to show my understanding of creating entries in a database and updating them, all with a fun and easy to use front-end. In the app, you can "make" and "devour" burgers and they will swap positions based on whether or not they have been eaten.

## Future Updates
I would like to add a simple function to delete old burgers that have been devoured. I would also like to make the UI a little more clean.
